After June 8, 2023, competitor container submissions will be evaluated using an 8-core CPU (no GPU)
with 32Gb of RAM (exact specifications TBD) on 50 randomized trials for each of the 8 competition
domains and the 5 instances released during the competition.

The average over all 50 trails will be taken as the raw score for each instance.

Normalized [0,1] instance scores will be computed according to the following lower and upper bounds:
- 0: max(noop policy, random policy).
- 1: max(JaxPlanner, best competing method).

A planner that does worse than 0 on this normalized scale will receive a 0. Each trial has a 2 minute
time limit; failure to execute any trial (e.g., crash) for an instance or exceeding the time limit in any trial
for an instance will lead to overall normalized score of 0 for that instance. No competitor can exceed a
score of 1, by definition.

Normalized domain scores will be computed as an average of normalized instance scores.

An overall competition score will be computed as an average of normalized domain scores.
